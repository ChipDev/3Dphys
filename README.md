# *3Dphys*

@chipdev

Relatively intuitive physics renderer. Proof of concept, leveraging pythons easy to use and implement libraries.
Sacrifices framerate for easy to understand and implementable code.

*TODO:
- Add math interpeter that is quick on the right side
- GRID TKINTER usage

Once the basic fundamentals are programmed:

- Navier-Stokes
- Wave animation (3D possible)
- Space simulation (3D)
